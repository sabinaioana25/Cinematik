# Android Developer Nanodegree Program | Popular Movies App

In this stage the task was to build the core experience of a movies app.
The app will:

- Present the user with a grid arrangement of movie posters upon launch
- Allow your user to change sort order via a setting, by most popular or by highest-rated
- Allow the user to tap on a movie poster and transition to a details screen with additional information such as original title,
movie poster image thumbnail and so on
- Allow users to view and play trailers ( either in the youtube app or a web browser).
- Allow users to read reviews of a selected movie.
- Also allow users to mark a movie as a favorite in the details view by tapping a button(star).
- Create a database to store the names and ids of the user's favorite movies (and optionally, the rest of the information needed to 
display their favorites collection while offline).
- Modify the existing sorting criteria for the main view to include an additional pivot to show their favorites collection.
